# fwi-NET
Wildfires can occasionally become destructive events, and are often difficult to predict due to a myriad of contributing environmental factors. I created fwiNET to present an artificial intelligence approach to predict wildfire intensity. The neural network, a multilayer perceptron, analyzes environmental factors that affect wildfire spreading. The factors are collectively known as the Fire Weather Index (FWI), a system developed by the Meteorological Service of Canada. FWI consists of various codes that reflect climate conditions at the fire source. The inputs I used in fwiNET are the Drought Code (DC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Buildup Index, (BUI), and the collective Fire Weather Index (FWI). fwiNET was trained using a dataset of FWI values for corresponding fires in the state of California during the year 2015, and these values were obtained by analyzing MERRA-2 data from NASA's Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED). The output neuron provides a projected value of the "fire size", or the burned area, of a wildfire given specific input conditions. I wrote fwiNET in the Python programming language, and used the Keras wrapper for the numerical library TensorFlow. I intend to improve fwiNET in several ways in the future, including analyzing a greater number of environmental factors, as well as using genetic algorithms to optimize the network's neural topology.
